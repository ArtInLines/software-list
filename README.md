# Software List

The following is a list of software that I use a lot and might need to download on different machines. The purpose of this list is to make migrating to new machines easier, by providing a list of software (with links to download it from), that I would need to install to continue working without issues.

I seperated the list into the following sections:
- Software
- Desktop Apps
- Mobile Apps

For the purposes of this list, "software" only includes software that doesn't have a desktop/mobile gui attached to it. Thus, it is mainly software needed for coding, though other gui-less software may be included in the list as well
