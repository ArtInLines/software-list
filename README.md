# Software List

The following is a list of software that I use a lot and might need to download on different machines. The purpose of this list is to make migrating to new machines easier, by providing a list of software (with links to download it from), that I would need to install to continue working without issues.

I seperated the list into the following sections:

-   Software
-   Desktop Apps
-   Mobile Apps

For the purposes of this list, "software" only includes software that doesn't have a desktop/mobile gui attached to it. Thus, it is mainly software needed for coding, though other gui-less software may be included in the list as well

## Software

### Git

https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Node JS & NPM

https://nodejs.org/en/

### Python & Pip

Take a look at downloading Jupyter Notebooks too maybe
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Julia

Take a look at downloading Jupyter Notebooks and/or Pluto.jl as well
https://julialang.org/downloads/

### C

### Prolog

### Common-Lisp

### Java

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### Jupyter Notebooks

You need to have python downloaded.

Then download jupyter lab and jupyter notebook as seen [here](https://jupyter.org/install), or simply by typing in the terminal:

```
pip install jupyterlab
pip install notebook
```

Run the software, by running `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook` in the terminal respectively.

#### Jupyter Kernels

Jupyter Notebooks run all code through so-called kernels, which evaluate the code. This allows the use of different kernels and thus different programming languages in jupyter notebooks.

Here's a list of all available jupyter kenels: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels

The following are a select list of kernels, that I use from time to time:

-   https://github.com/yunabe/tslab
-   https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl

### Pluto.jl

In the Julia REPL, simply press `]` and then `add Pluto`.

Run Pluto by writing `import Pluto` and then `Pluto.run()`
